# Employee Data Management System

This is a full-stack Employee Data Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to manage employee data efficiently.

## Features

- Add employee data with name, email, and age.
- Delete employee data from the system.
- Display employee information in a user-friendly interface.
- Secure storage of employee data in MongoDB to ensure data integrity.

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: React.js with React Router for client-side routing.
- Back-end: Node.js and Express.js to create a robust RESTful API.
- Database: MongoDB for secure storage of employee information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the MongoDB database and configure the connection in the server code.
4. Run the development server using `npm start`.
5. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run dev`: Builds the app for production.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, run `npm run dev` to generate the production build. Then, deploy the build folder to your hosting platform.

## Code Splitting and Bundle Analysis

To optimize the application's performance, code splitting and bundle size analysis are essential. Refer to the documentation for more information on [code splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting) and [analyzing bundle size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).
